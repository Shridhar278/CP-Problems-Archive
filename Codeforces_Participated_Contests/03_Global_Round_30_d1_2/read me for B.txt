CLAIM smallest SUCH sequence upto max hits 10^9
the smallest of them can be
[ 2, 7, 19, 43, 115, 271, 547, 1153, 2329, 4903, 9931, 23311,
62359, 141475, 284593, 657595, 1416805, 2903545, 6914335,
14468161, 29197201, 59771995, 128216119, 292016107, 610385275 ]

which is only 26 long hence,
The Worst Case Scenario of O(n^2) won't hit in this case (only 26)
hence, O(n^2) theoretical time complexity works cuz. you can't make a sequence more than 26 long to encounter TLE

# WORST CASES are NOT the ONLY CASES...
# NICE MATH insight on CODING problem


#CHATGPT approximations...

2. Excellent observation — and yes, **almost** exponential, though not in the clean (a_{n+1} = c,a_n) sense. Let’s unpack why that happens for
[
2,,3,,7,,19,,43,,127,,271,\dots
]

---

### 1. The condition recap

We require that for all (x<y),
[
y\bmod x \text{ is odd.}
]
and the sequence is strictly increasing.

With (2) and (3) included, every new term (y) must satisfy:

* (y) **odd** (since (y\bmod2=1)), and
* (y \equiv 1 \pmod{3}) (since (y\bmod3=1)).

Thus (y = 6k + 1).

Each new (x) introduces another modular filter: (y \bmod x) must be odd, meaning
[
y \not\equiv 0 \pmod{x}, \quad y\not\equiv \text{even residue mod }x.
]
That chops off half of the remaining residues modulo (x).

---

### 2. Why the gaps grow rapidly

By the time you have a few elements (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n):

* Each (x_i) bans roughly **half** of the residues mod (x_i).
* These constraints are **independent-ish**, so the density of valid (y) among integers shrinks roughly by a factor of (½) per term.

So the fraction of valid integers left ≈ ( (½)^{n-2} ).

The typical next (y) is roughly inversely proportional to that density ⇒
[
a_{n+1} \sim 2^{n-2}.
]

That’s **exponential growth** in index (n) —
though the exact constant fluctuates due to residue coincidences.

---

### 3. Numerical growth pattern

| n | term | ratio (a_{n+1}/a_n) |
| - | ---- | ------------------- |
| 1 | 2    | —                   |
| 2 | 3    | 1.5                 |
| 3 | 7    | 2.33                |
| 4 | 19   | 2.71                |
| 5 | 43   | 2.26                |
| 6 | 127  | 2.95                |
| 7 | 271  | 2.13                |

Ratios hover around 2–3 — roughly doubling or tripling each step.
That’s consistent with “exponential-like” growth (base ≈ 2.3).

---

### 4. Expected asymptotic behaviour

Greedy filter sequences like this behave roughly as:
[
a_n \approx c , \alpha^n,\quad \alpha \in (2,3),
]
where (c) depends on the early residues (your first few terms).

So yes — it’s *exponential-type* growth, not perfectly geometric but increasing at a similar rate.

---

**In short:**
The sequence grows **exponentially** because every new constraint (each earlier (x)) halves the available candidates on average, forcing the next valid (y) roughly twice as far out.
